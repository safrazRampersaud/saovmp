README CONTENT FILE FOR SHARING-AWARE ONLINE VIRTUAL MACHINE PACKING (saovmp) SIMULATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(I)	Compilation from Direct Repository ZIP download (saovmp_repository) 
(II)	Execution
(III)	Required Files
(IV)	Server Data Set Inputs
(V)	VM Data Set Inputs
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(I)	@user > g++ -std=c++11 -o saovmp saovmp.cpp

(II) 	@user > (executable) (vm input) (server input)
	Ex:	@user > saovmp vmExp_300_100_5 serverExp_300

	Execution should follow pattern: "@user > saovmp vmExp_X00_100_5 serverExp_X00" where X = {3,5,10}.  
	See (IV) and (V) for more details.
		
(III)	.hpp files: [HPP]
	(a)	saovmp_consts.hpp 		- stores constant values throughout saovmp simulation in namespace
	(b)	saovmp_model.hpp		- stores all sharing-(aware/oblivious) algorithms for 
						  simulation and processes the results for reporting
	(c)	srv_model.hpp			- server abstraction file for saovmp simulation 
	(c)	vms_model.hpp			- virtual machine (vm) abstraction file for saovmp simulation including 
						  vm characteristic loading
	resource files: [RESOURCES]
	(a)	VM_assign_AP			- Constraint matrix file for identifying legal applications (abstracted) 
						  VMs may choose thoughout experiment
	(b)	VM_assign_EnumAP		- Constraint array file for identifying legal count of applications (abstracted) 
						  VMs may choose thoughout experiment
	(c)	VM_assign_OS			- Constraint matrix file for identifying legal operating systems (abstracted) 
						  VMs may choose
	(d)	getApplicationPages 		- Component file for application (abstracted) pages expressed in bits
	(e)	getOperatingSystemPages 	- Component file for operating system (abstracted) pages expressed in bits
	(f)	vmTypes				- Enumeration file for Google Compute Engine VMs (abstracted)

(IV)	Three data files have been uploaded for the variations in the server environment abstraction:
		(a)	serverExp_300		- Server file consisting of 300 servers with identified capacities on CPUs & Memory
		(b)	serverExp_500		- Server file consisting of 500 servers with identified capacities on CPUs & Memory
		(c)	serverExp_1000		- Server file consisting of 1000 servers with identified capacities on CPUs & Memory

		Each of the files consists of the following data orginization:
			(1)	CPU capacity in cores (abstracted) in the 1st column
			(2)	Memory capacity in GBs (abstracted) in the 2nd column
			(3)	Count of servers (abstracted) with tuple ((1), (2)) server resource combination in 3rd column
									  
(V)	Three folders have been uploaded for the variations on the VM request stream abstraction:

		(a)	300			- 11 various vm input files consisting of 300 VMs in request stream 
		(b) 	500			- 11 various vm input files consisting of 500 VMs in request stream
		(c)	1000			- 11 various vm input files consisting of 1000 VMs in request stream						
									  
		Each of the files consists of the following data orginization:
			(1)	VM type from Google Compute Engine (abstracted) in the 1st column
			(2)	CPU request in cores (abstracted) in the 2nd column 
			(3)	Memory request in GBs (abstracted) in the 3rd column
			(4)	Maximum amount of (IV.3) memory which can be shared in GBs (abstracted) in the 4th column 
			(5)	Maximum amount of (IV.3) memory which is not sharable in GBs (abstracted) in the 5th column
